Analysis of Aave V2 Wallet Scores
This document provides an analysis of the credit scores generated for wallets interacting with the Aave V2 protocol. The analysis is based on a sample of 100,000 transactions.

Score Distribution
The credit scores are distributed on a scale from 0 to 1000. The histogram below shows the concentration of wallets across different score ranges.

Observations:

The vast majority of wallets are concentrated in the 600-800 score range. This suggests that most users in the dataset exhibit moderately positive or responsible behavior.

There is a significant peak in the 600-650 range, indicating a large group of "average" users.

Very few wallets scored below 500, which implies that outright risky behavior (like getting liquidated) is relatively rare in this specific dataset.

A smaller, but still significant, number of wallets achieved high scores (800+), representing the most reliable users.

Behavior of Wallet Tiers
To understand the practical meaning of the scores, we can analyze the underlying features of wallets in different score tiers.

High-Scoring Wallets (Score: 850-1000)
These wallets represent the "gold standard" of users on the protocol. Their behavior is characterized by:

Zero Liquidations: These users have never been liquidated.

High Repayment Ratio: They consistently repay more than they borrow, or they borrow very little relative to their deposits. Their repayment_ratio is often at the capped value of 5.0 or very close to 1.0.

High Activity: They tend to have a higher-than-average transaction_count and lifespan_days, indicating they are active, long-term participants.

Significant Deposits: Many of these wallets have high total_deposits_usd, showing they trust the protocol with significant capital.

Conclusion: High-scoring wallets are capital-efficient, low-risk, and highly engaged users who are ideal from the protocol's perspective.

Mid-Scoring Wallets (Score: 600-850)
This is the largest group and represents the "average" Aave user. Their characteristics include:

No Liquidations: The vast majority of these users have never been liquidated.

Variable Repayment Ratio: Their repayment habits are mixed. Many have a ratio near 1.0, but some may have open loans (ratio < 1.0). They are generally responsible but may actively use leverage.

Varied Activity: This group includes both new users with short lifespans and older, less active users.

Conclusion: These wallets are the backbone of the protocol. They are generally reliable but may not be as capital-efficient or as active as the top-tier users.

Low-Scoring Wallets (Score: 0-500)
While rare in this dataset, low-scoring wallets exhibit clear signs of risk or unusual behavior.

Liquidations: The single biggest factor driving a low score is having one or more liquidation_count. A single liquidation event heavily penalizes a wallet's score.

Poor Repayment History: These wallets often have a repayment_ratio of 0, meaning they have outstanding debt with no history of repayment in the dataset.

Short Lifespan: Many have a very short lifespan_days, suggesting they may be one-off bots or users who abandoned the protocol after a negative event.

Conclusion: Low-scoring wallets are high-risk and have a history of financial distress on the protocol.

Overall Summary
The heuristic scoring model successfully differentiates wallets based on their on-chain behavior. It effectively identifies reliable, long-term users and flags high-risk wallets that have experienced liquidations. The score distribution suggests a healthy user base in the provided dataset, with a large majority of users demonstrating responsible financial habits.
